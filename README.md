## Features

- **Swin2sr Model:** Utilizes the Swin Transformer architecture for cutting-edge image super-resolution.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** An easy-to-use command-line interface for quick image enhancement.
- **Configurability:** Advanced users can customize parameters for specific use cases.
- **Open Source:** ISR is an open-source project, encouraging collaboration and improvement.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and use ISR on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch (version x.x.x)
- Other dependencies...

### Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pirate-Emperor/ISR.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd ISR
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Enhance the resolution of an image using the following command:

```bash
python isr.py --input /path/to/input_image.jpg --output /path/to/output_image.jpg
```

Adjust other parameters as needed for your specific use case.
